        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        
        <p>This Privacy Policy describes our practices regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information through the Monkey Block browser extension ("Service", "we", "us", or "our") and applies to all users of our Service. By using our Service, you agree to the collection and use of information in accordance with this policy.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        
        <p>We collect several types of information to provide and improve our Service. Our data collection practices are designed to enable core functionality while respecting user privacy. We employ various technical and organizational measures to ensure that data collection is proportionate to the intended purposes.</p>

        <h3>Information We Collect</h3>
        
        <p>In the course of providing our Service, we may collect and process the following categories of information:</p>
        
        <h4>Usage Information</h4>
        <p>When you use our Service, we automatically collect certain information about your interaction with the extension. This usage data may include information such as the time spent on websites you've chosen to track, the frequency of your visits to these sites, and patterns of usage throughout the day. This information is primarily stored locally on your device and is used to provide you with productivity insights and enforce the limits you've configured. We may also collect aggregated and anonymized usage metrics to understand how our features are being utilized and to identify areas for improvement.</p>
        
        <h4>Device and Technical Information</h4>
        <p>We collect information about the device and browser environment in which our extension operates. This includes technical specifications such as your browser type and version, operating system, screen resolution, hardware capabilities, language preferences, and timezone settings. We may also generate a browser fingerprint using various technical parameters to maintain service continuity and provide consistent analytics across installation sessions. This fingerprint is created using standard browser APIs and cannot be used to personally identify you.</p>
        
        <h4>Configuration and Preferences</h4>
        <p>The Service stores various configuration settings and preferences that you establish, including but not limited to: website time limits, blacklisted domains, feature toggles, user interface customizations, and personalized content such as motivational quotes. These preferences may be synchronized across devices if you have Chrome synchronization enabled, utilizing Google's infrastructure for cross-device consistency.</p>
        
        <h4>Analytics and Performance Data</h4>
        <p>To improve our Service and understand user behavior patterns, we collect analytics data through integrated third-party services. This includes event data about feature usage, interaction patterns, error occurrences, and performance metrics. We utilize Amplitude for product analytics, which processes data in accordance with their privacy policy and maintains infrastructure within the European Union for GDPR compliance. Analytics data is associated with a pseudonymous identifier that is not linked to your personal identity.</p>
        
        <h4>Geographic Information</h4>
        <p>We may determine your approximate geographic location at the country and city level through IP address geolocation. This process is handled by third-party services and we do not store your IP address. Location information is used for analytics purposes, to provide localized experiences, and to ensure compliance with regional regulations.</p>

        <h3>How We Process Information</h3>
        
        <p>The information we collect is processed for various legitimate purposes essential to the operation and improvement of our Service. Processing activities are conducted in accordance with applicable data protection principles including purpose limitation, data minimization, and storage limitation.</p>
        
        <p>Primary processing purposes include: delivering core Service functionality such as time tracking and website blocking; generating usage statistics and productivity insights; synchronizing settings across devices; improving Service performance and user experience; identifying and resolving technical issues; conducting aggregated analytics to understand usage patterns; developing new features based on user needs; and ensuring Service security and preventing abuse.</p>
        
        <p>We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure that processing activities are secure and that data is protected against unauthorized access, alteration, or disclosure. These measures include encryption of data in transit, secure storage practices, access controls, and regular security assessments.</p>

        <h2>Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
        
        <p>We are committed to protecting your privacy and do not sell, rent, or trade your personal information. We may share information only in the following limited circumstances:</p>
        
        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        <p>We engage certain third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service and to perform Service-related functions. These service providers have access to your information only to perform specific tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose. Our primary service providers include analytics platforms for understanding usage patterns and geolocation services for determining approximate location from IP addresses.</p>
        
        <h3>Legal Requirements</h3>
        <p>We may disclose your information if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities. This includes situations where disclosure is necessary to comply with a legal obligation, protect and defend our rights or property, prevent or investigate possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service, protect the personal safety of users or the public, or protect against legal liability.</p>
        
        <h3>Business Transfers</h3>
        <p>In the event of a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your information may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice before your information is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
        
        <h3>Aggregated and Anonymized Data</h3>
        <p>We may share aggregated and anonymized information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you. This may include aggregate usage statistics, demographic information, and general usage patterns that help us understand how our Service is being used and how we can improve it.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        
        <p>The security of your information is important to us, and we strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, or disclosure.</p>
        
        <p>We utilize a variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. These measures include technical safeguards such as encryption, organizational measures such as access controls, and physical security measures where applicable. However, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the information we have collected from you.</p>
        
        <p>The majority of your data is stored locally on your device using Chrome's storage APIs, which benefit from the security measures implemented by your browser and operating system. Data that is synchronized across devices utilizes Google's infrastructure and security measures. Analytics data is transmitted securely to our service providers using industry-standard encryption protocols.</p>

        <h2>International Data Transfers</h2>
        
        <p>Your information may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those from your jurisdiction. If you are located outside the United States and choose to provide information to us, please note that we transfer the information, including personal information, to the United States and process it there.</p>
        
        <p>For users in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, and Switzerland, we ensure that any transfer of personal information to countries outside of these regions is conducted in accordance with appropriate safeguards, such as standard contractual clauses approved by the European Commission or other legally recognized transfer mechanisms.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
        
        <p>Depending on your location and applicable laws, you may have certain rights regarding your information. These rights may include the ability to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your personal information. The specific rights available to you may vary based on your jurisdiction.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Access and Portability</h3>
        <p>You may have the right to request access to the information we hold about you and to receive that information in a commonly used format. Much of your data is already accessible directly through the extension's interface, where you can view your usage statistics, settings, and preferences.</p>
        
        <h3>Data Correction and Deletion</h3>
        <p>You can update or correct most of your information directly through the extension's settings. If you wish to delete your information, you can uninstall the extension, which will remove all locally stored data. For data held by our service providers, deletion requests may be subject to their respective policies and legal obligations.</p>
        
        <h3>Opt-Out Rights</h3>
        <p>You may opt out of certain data collection practices by adjusting your extension settings or by uninstalling the extension. Some features of the Service may require certain data to function properly, and opting out of data collection may affect the availability of these features.</p>
        
        <h3>Do Not Track</h3>
        <p>Some browsers include a Do Not Track ("DNT") feature that signals to websites that you do not want to have your online activity tracked. Our Service does not currently respond to DNT signals as there is no universally accepted standard for how to respond to such signals.</p>

        <div class="legal-section">
            <h3>Legal Basis for Processing (GDPR)</h3>
            <p>For users in the European Economic Area, we process personal data based on the following legal grounds: (i) your consent to process your personal data for one or more specific purposes; (ii) processing is necessary for the performance of the Service you have requested; (iii) processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; (iv) processing is necessary to protect the vital interests of you or another person; (v) processing is necessary for the purposes of legitimate interests pursued by us or a third party, except where such interests are overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
            
            <p>Our legitimate interests include: providing and improving the Service; understanding how users interact with our Service; ensuring network and information security; preventing fraud and abuse; and marketing our services to interested users. When we process personal information to meet our legitimate interests, we put in place robust safeguards to ensure that your privacy is protected and to ensure that our legitimate interests are not overridden by your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        
        <p>Our Service is not directed to individuals under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13 without verification of parental consent, we take steps to remove that information from our servers. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please contact us so that we can take appropriate action.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        
        <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in our practices, technologies, legal requirements, and other factors. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the effective date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes. Changes to this Privacy Policy are effective when they are posted on this page.</p>
        
        <p>Your continued use of the Service after we post any modifications to the Privacy Policy on this page will constitute your acknowledgment of the modifications and your consent to abide and be bound by the modified Privacy Policy. If we make any material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you through the Service or by other means to provide you an opportunity to review the changes before they become effective.</p>

        <h2>California Privacy Rights</h2>
        
        <p>If you are a California resident, California law may provide you with additional rights regarding our use of your personal information. California's "Shine the Light" law permits users who are California residents to request certain information regarding our disclosure of personal information to third parties for their direct marketing purposes. We do not share personal information with third parties for their direct marketing purposes.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provides California residents with specific rights regarding their personal information. These rights include the right to know what personal information is being collected, the right to know whether personal information is sold or disclosed and to whom, the right to say no to the sale of personal information, the right to access personal information, the right to request deletion of personal information, and the right to equal service and price even if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>

        <h2>European Privacy Rights</h2>
        
        <p>If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), United Kingdom, or Switzerland, you may have additional rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) or equivalent legislation.
